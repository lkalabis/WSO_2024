This repository was initially created as an handout for my presentation at the [Wir sind Ohana 2024](https://www.wirsindohana.de) event in 2024.
I would love to see this repository grow and become a valuable resource for everyone who is working with the Salesforce (Translation) Metadata API.

In this file you can find different examples of how to use the `package.xml` file to retrieve metadata from Salesforce especiall in relation to translations.
You can copy the examples and adjust them to your needs.

Additionally, you can find the corresponding commands to retrieve the metadata using the Salesforce CLI.

Feel free to clone this repository and/or contribute to it. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
